## 4️⃣ Tech Stack (With Purpose)

| Technology | Why It Was Chosen |
|----------|------------------|
| **Angular 17+** | Modern, scalable frontend with strict typing |
| **TypeScript 5** | Prevents runtime errors, improves maintainability |
| **RxJS** | Efficient async data handling |
| **SCSS + Bootstrap 5** | Custom design with responsive grid system |
| **Spring Boot 3** | Enterprise-grade backend framework |
| **Spring Data JPA** | Clean database abstraction |
| **MySQL** | Structured, relational data storage |

---

## 5️⃣ System Architecture (Simple)

### High-Level Flow
```
User Interface (Angular) → REST API (Spring Boot) → Database (MySQL) → File System
```

### API Design
- `POST /api/save-movie` → Upload movie + media assets  
- `GET /api/get-all-movies` → Fetch movie listings  
- `GET /api/get-by-id/{id}` → Detailed movie view  

### Data Flow
1. Admin fills movie form  
2. Angular sends **FormData (JSON + Images)**  
3. Backend stores metadata in DB  
4. Images stored securely on server  
5. Frontend loads assets via mapped URLs
